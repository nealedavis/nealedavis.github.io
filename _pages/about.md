I am teaching assistant professor in computer science and a [Software Carpentry](https://www.software-carpentry.org/) instructor and trainer.

My background is in nuclear engineering.  I am interested as well in high-performance computing, engineering pedagogy, the history and philosophy of science, and [institutional epistemology](https://old.reddit.com/r/InStep/).
