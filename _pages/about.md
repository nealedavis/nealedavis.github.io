I am a teaching assistant professor in computer science at the University of Illinois and a [Software Carpentry](https://www.software-carpentry.org/) instructor (2013–present) and trainer (active 2016–2020).

My background is in nuclear engineering.  I have taught coursework in progamming for engineers (Python and MATLAB), software development tools and techniques, computational fluid dynamics, and finite element analysis.  I am furthermore interested in high-performance computing, engineering pedagogy, the history and philosophy of science, and [institutional epistemology](https://old.reddit.com/r/InStep/).

I have been extensively involved in training and pedagogy for engineers, including co-developing [a workshop for farmers to learn how to use data with the Center for Digital Agriculture](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/data-harvesting-for-agriculture) and [supporting scramjet research by undergraduate researchers with the Center for Exascale-Enabled Scramjet Design](https://github.com/davis68/summer-reu).  I actively work with [Computational Science and Engineering](https://cse.illinois.edu/training) to produce training workshops across a variety of technical topics.

I have developed a number of new courses over the past several years:

- CS 101 “Introduction to Programming for Scientists and Engineers” (the campus introduction covering Python and MATLAB; some years the single largest lecture section on campus with 720 students in one room)
- CS 199PY “Python for Data”; CS 491TC “Tradecraft for Coders” (the +1 guide to what fell through the cracks of your CS education)
- CS 498MC “Martian Computing” (the first university course on the Urbit operating system)
- ENG 498IM “Interdisciplinary Methods in Research Computing” (foundational principles for open science/open research, emphasizing reproducibility and task automation)
- ME 498CM “Tools of Computational Mechanics” (a practical guide to working with finite element structural analysis and computational fluid dynamics software)
