I am a teaching assistant professor in computer science at the University of Illinois and a [Software Carpentry](https://www.software-carpentry.org/) instructor and trainer.

My background is in nuclear engineering.  I have taught coursework in progamming for engineers (Python and MATLAB), software development tools and techniques, computational fluid dynamics, and finite element analysis.  I am furthermore interested in high-performance computing, engineering pedagogy, the history and philosophy of science, and [institutional epistemology](https://old.reddit.com/r/InStep/).
